# Pure md editor:
This is a simple markdown editor

## What I learned
I did this primarally to learn react and other branching technologies, the most important of which would be Redux. A markdown editor does not need to use Redux in fact few applications will need to. I did not fully grasp this concept before I started building this app and by making the mistake I have learned. As for "soft skills" this app was made for a friend and talored specifically for them, thus it was a gental but practical introduction to fast bug fixing, catering to an audiance, and interpreting other's wishes.

## Tools I used
- Reactjs
- Codemirror
- Aphrodite
- Redux
- SASS
- React Router
